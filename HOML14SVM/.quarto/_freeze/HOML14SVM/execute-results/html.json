with maximum separation (2M) between classes\n-   Maximizing distance to closest points from either class\n-   Points on the margin are Support Vectors\n\n## Soft Margin Classifier {.smaller}\n\n-   Sometimes data are separable by hyperplane\n-   HMC not robust for noisy data\n-   Solution:\n    -   allow points in margin or on wrong side hyperplane\n    -   budget for wrong points $C$

more features\n-  Here with $X_3 = X_1^2 + X_2^2$, a polynomial function degree 2\n-  With new feature space hyperplane still linear, not so in original feature space\n\n## Support Vector Machines\n\n-  Enlarge feature space in structured way, with *kernels*\n-  Polynomial kernel degree $d$ and scale $\\gamma$:\n     -  $K(x_i,x_{i'}) = \\gamma(1+\\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}x_{i'j})^d$\n-  Radial kernel: \n    -  $K(x_i,x_{i'}) = exp( \\gamma \\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij}-x_{i'j})^2)$, with $\\gamma = \\frac 1 {2\\sigma^2}$\n-  ...\n-  Hyperparameters found with tuning\n-  SVMs are extremely
