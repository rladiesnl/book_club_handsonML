# Welcome!

&nbsp;

- This meetup is part of a joint effort between RLadies Den Bosch and Utrecht  
&nbsp;

--

-  We meet every 2 weeks to go through a chapter of the book ["Hands-On Machine Learning with R"](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) by Bradley Boehme and Brandon Greenwell.

&nbsp;
--

- We will not record the session, but we will publish the slides. 

&nbsp;

--- 

# Some house rules

- R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.  See [the code of conduct.](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/)

- During todays' session, we can work together in a hackmd file: https://hackmd.io/EhYe_gkWScuoaVCIH6QLAg

---

# What to expect

- Presentations summarising the key points on each topic of the book

--

&nbsp;

- Putting the theory to practice by going through exercises together

--

&nbsp;
- Room to discuss questions and other thoughts

--

&nbsp;
- It is not necessary to read the chapters in advance, but feel free to do so.

# The book 'Hands-On Machine learning with R



- Mainly about supervised learning (Ch 4-14)

&nbsp;

- Maximize effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretation of your ML models (Ch 15-16)

&nbsp;

- Unsupervised learning (Ch 17 - 22)

&nbsp;

--

### Get experience with Machine Learning in R while minimizing theory

---

# Ch 1 'Introduction to Machine Learning' 


What is a machine learning algorithm? 


---

# Supervised learners

- Predictive models
-- 
-  "attempts to discover and model the relationships among the target variable and the other features"
  
&nbsp;
  
- Target <span style="color:red">Y</span>, predictors <span style="color:blue">X</span>
  

### Examples 

- Predict <span style="color:red">temperature</span> from <span style="color:blue">time of the day </span> and <span style="color:blue">season</span>

--

&nbsp;

- Using <span style="color:blue">patient attributes</span> and <span style="color:blue">symptoms </span> to predict the <span style="color:red">risk of readmission</span>

&nbsp;


---

## Unsupervised learners 
  
- Descriptive models

&nbsp;

--

- There is no target variable
&nbsp;


### Examples

--

- Divide consumers into different homogeneous groups
&nbsp;

--

- Reduce the feature set to a potentially smaller set of uncorrelated variables 

---


### Two types of supervised learners: 

--

- Continuous Target Variable: Regression problem 
&nbsp;


- Categorical Target Variable: Classification problem
&nbsp;


--

### Two types of unsupervised learners:
--

- Defined by the rows: Clustering
&nbsp;

- Defined by the columns: Dimension reduction 
&nbsp;

# Quiz:

Supervised or unsupervised?

# Chapter 2 - Modeling process

Building a machine learning model is an iterative process

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/modeling_process.png")
```


---

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Helper packages
library(dplyr)     # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2)   # for awesome graphics

# Modeling process packages
library(rsample)   # for resampling procedures
library(caret)     # for resampling and model training

```





# Data splitting
- Goal: find function $f(x)$ that predicts future values $\hat{y}$ based on features $X$. 
&nbsp;

- To get an understanding how well our model transfers to unseen data


---

# Example from the book: Ames housing data

- Property sales information 
- 80 features
- 2,930 observations

--

```{r}
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
head(ames) %>% knitr::kable()
```

---

# Example from the book: Ames housing data

Randomly sample 70% train data and 30% test data: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data_split.png")
```

--

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
index <- sample(1:nrow(ames), round(nrow(ames) * 0.7))
train <- ames[index, ]
test  <- ames[-index, ]
```

- The 'train' set is used to develop a model
- The 'test' is used to evaluate model performance

---

# Example from the book: Ames housing data.


- We want to use all the features to predict the houses' sales price.

--

- Supervised or unsupervised? 
- Regression or classification?

--

- This problem requires supervised learning: We want to predict Y from features X
- The outcome is a continuous variable, therefore: a regression problem 
- In the example we will use the algorithm 'K-Nearest-Neighbours'


---

# Hyperparameter tuning for KNN 

For KNN, we need to set a value for hyperparameter K

```{r}
# Create grid of hyperparameter values
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(k = seq(2, 25, by = 1))
hyper_grid 
```

--- 
# Resampling methods

How to evaluate performance on the _training_ set? 

---

## K-fold cross-validation

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cv.png")
```

---

## How to code this in R

```{r}
# Specify resampling strategy
cv <- trainControl(
  method = "repeatedcv", 
  number = 10, 
  repeats = 5
)
```

---

## Bootstrapping
Another method would be bootstrapping: Resampling data _with replacement_

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bootstrap-scheme.png")
```


---
# Now it is time to fit the model on the training data

```{r cache = TRUE}
# Tune a knn model using grid search
knn_fit <- train(
  Sale_Price ~ ., 
  data = train, 
  method = "knn", 
  trControl = cv, 
  tuneGrid = hyper_grid,
  metric = "MSE"
)
```

--

- We fit a KNN model for all different hyperparameter values (k)

--

- We use the MSE to evaluate performance (explained later)

-- 

- We resample the dataset by cross-validation 


---

# Inspect results

```{r}
knn_fit
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(knn_fit)
```
---

# Model evaluation 

Predictive accuracy of a model is assessed by some loss function.



## For regression models
For example: difference betwen actual and predicted values, squared: 

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} (y_{i} - \hat{y})^2$$

--

The smaller the MSE, the more accurate a model can predict $y$. 

## For classification models
For example: in how many cases does the model predict the correct category?

$$accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{n}$$
---

# Extra: Bias-variance tradeoff 
## There are two types of prediction errors.. 

_Bias_ = how far off are you models predictions from the true value?
- sense of how well the model conforms to the underlying structure in the data



```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/modeling-process-bias-model-1.png")
```

---

# Extra: Bias-variance tradeoff
## There are two types of prediction errors.. 

_Variance_ = the variability of a model prediction for a given data point
- overfitting
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/modeling-process-variance-model-1.png")
```

# Share your experience

# .fancy[Thank you!]
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
#knitr::include_graphics("files/thankyou.gif")
```
